Project 1: Sales Performance Dashboard
This interactive dashboard tracks total sales, net profit, units sold, and average profit margin across multiple countries and market segments.
Users can filter by region, segment, and country to explore trends in real time.
I used DAX to create custom KPIs and designed the visuals for executive-level reporting.
The dashboard includes a combination of bar charts, pie charts, line charts, and KPI cards for a comprehensive performance overview.
